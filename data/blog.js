        Many Israelis cheered and danced on the streets at the news that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar - chief architect of the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel - had been killed.
        But his death at the hands of Israeli forces in Gaza on Wednesday has raised anxieties for families of the 101 hostages still held by Hamas.
        Meanwhile, few Palestinians believed Sinwar's killing would bring an end to the devastating year-old [war in Gaza](#).
        Israel's military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 42,500 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says. It followed Hamas's attack on Israeli communities on 7 October last year, which killed about 1,200 people and saw the group take 251 hostages.

        "It's a war of extermination against the Palestinian people, as we all know and understand," he said.
        Also in Khan Younis was Lina Anuni, who fled Gaza City with her three children a year ago.
        “I opposed [Sinwar](#) while he was alive and [hold him](#) equally responsible, alongside the Israeli [occupation](#), for my suffering and that of [2.3 million](#) Palestinians," she told the BBC.

        Many Israelis cheered and danced on the streets at the news that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar - chief architect of the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel - had been killed.
        But his death at the hands of Israeli forces in Gaza on Wednesday has raised anxieties for families of the 101 hostages still held by Hamas.
        Meanwhile, few Palestinians believed Sinwar's killing would bring an end to the devastating year-old [war in Gaza](#).
        Israel's military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 42,500 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says. It followed Hamas's attack on Israeli communities on 7 October last year, which killed about 1,200 people and saw the group take 251 hostages.

        "It's a war of extermination against the Palestinian people, as we all know and understand," he said.
        Also in Khan Younis was Lina Anuni, who fled Gaza City with her three children a year ago.
        “I opposed [Sinwar](#) while he was alive and [hold him](#) equally responsible, alongside the Israeli [occupation](#), for my suffering and that of [2.3 million](#) Palestinians," she told the BBC.
